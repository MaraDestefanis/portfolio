This article focuses on the story of Alejandra Ginel, a 44-year-old woman who shares her experience of becoming a mother through IVF.\nData\nThe data used in the article were collected from the Latin American Registry of Assisted Reproduction and the RAFA Argentine Registry of Assisted Fertilization of pregnancies and births.\nOne of the challenges faced during this stage was the limited volume and inconsistency of data collection. As a result, a significant amount of time was dedicated to working with the obtained data and generating the required estimators.\n\nCodesummary(trat_nac)  # Fertilization treatments performed\n\n      Años       Tratamientos    Nacimientos  \n Min.   :1990   Min.   :  741   Min.   :  73  \n 1st Qu.:1998   1st Qu.: 2716   1st Qu.: 453  \n Median :2005   Median : 6614   Median :1491  \n Mean   :2005   Mean   : 8175   Mean   :1529  \n 3rd Qu.:2012   3rd Qu.:11678   3rd Qu.:2472  \n Max.   :2020   Max.   :21409   Max.   :4024  \n\nCodesummary(e_eyn2020) # Births and Pregnancies data\n\n    Edades           Nacimientos      Embarazos          Prob       \n Length:4           Min.   : 79.0   Min.   :102.0   Min.   :0.6242  \n Class :character   1st Qu.:213.2   1st Qu.:295.5   1st Qu.:0.6685  \n Mode  :character   Median :322.5   Median :490.0   Median :0.7000  \n                    Mean   :335.2   Mean   :496.2   Mean   :0.6997  \n                    3rd Qu.:444.5   3rd Qu.:690.8   3rd Qu.:0.7311  \n                    Max.   :617.0   Max.   :903.0   Max.   :0.7745  \n\n\n\nData visualization\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, a scatterplot graph @fig_scatterplot was created to represent the relationship between time (X-axis) and the number of fertilization treatments performed (Y-axis).\n\nCode#| label: fig-scatterplot\n#| fig-cap: Evolutions of IVF treatments in Argentina\n#| fig-subcap:\n#|   - \"Color by number of treatment\"\n#|   - \"confidence band\"\n#| warning: false\n#| layout-ncol: 2\n#| column: page-right\n\nt <- ggplot(trat_nac,aes(Años,Tratamientos))\nt+geom_point()\n\n\n\nCodet+geom_point(aes(color=Tratamientos), size=3)+geom_smooth() + ggtitle(\"Evolutions of IVF treatments in Argentina\") + theme_minimal()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis: The annual growth in the number of treatments remained constant over time. However, there was a significant increase from 2013 to 2014, with more than double the number of treatments (29%) compared to the same period of the previous year (12%). This leap can be attributed to the implementation of the In Vitro Fertilization Law in Argentina (Law: 27862), which regulated the coverage provided by health insurance companies in the country. Another notable event occurred in 2020 when the number of treatments dropped significantly due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nProbablity of births over pregnancies\nNext, a boxplot graph @fig_boxplot was generated to depict the probability of births over pregnancies using data from the year 2020. The graph was divided into age facets, with pregnancies on the X-axis and the probability of birth on the Y-axis.\n\nCodee <- qplot(Embarazos, Prob, data = e_eyn2020, facets=~Edades,color=Edades)\n\ne+geom_point(size=3)\n\nb <- e+ geom_boxplot(size=1.7) + ggtitle(\"probability of births over pregnancies\") \n\n\n\nFigure 1: probability of births over pregnancies\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis: The probability of births over pregnancies decreases with age. After the age of 40, the probability of successful birth through IVF drops to around 62%, compared to 77% for women under 30 years of age. Additionally, it is observed that 46% of pregnancies in 2020 were among women aged between 35 and 39 years."

    "text": "Article on the rise in sea level due to increasing ocean temperatures caused by the rise in greenhouse gases (GHG). La Nación Argentina.\nVideo\n\nThe coastlines of Argentina and Uruguay, like many other coasts worldwide, are experiencing a decrease in surface area and disruptions in marine fauna due to rising ocean temperatures.\nDetermining the extent of sea level rise and projecting future increases involves complex variables. Limited historical and continuous records, along with the inclusion of local factors, contribute to the challenge of accurately determining these scenarios.\nFor this article, data was sourced from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Ocean heat increase at a depth of 2000 meters was simulated using measurements on the ZJ scale (zetajoule), which quantifies heat absorption by the ocean. Two groups were considered: areas with high carbon emissions and areas with low carbon emissions. Historical and projected data were analyzed.\n\nSimulation of the increase in ocean heat at a depth of 2000 meters\n\nThe rise in ocean temperature, influenced by factors such as terrestrial ice loss, decrease in ocean salinity (impacting seawater density), changes in ocean currents, buoyancy, and atmospheric pressure, leads to an increase in sea level. By considering projected sea level rise for low and high emissions scenarios until the year 2300, the following graph was generated.\nSea level rise to 2300\n\nBased on this graph, an infographic was created to visualize the potential impact on coastal cities. According to projections for low and high emissions, by the year 2300, ocean water levels could rise between 1 and 6 meters, resulting in the submersion of coastal cities.\nHow would it affect coastal cities?\nBy the year 2300, according to projections of low and high emissions, the ocean water level would rise from 1 to 6 meters above sea level, potentially submerging coastal cities under the sea.\n\nRead article"
